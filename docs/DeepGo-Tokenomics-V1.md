## DeepGo Token Distribution and Unlocking
The total amount of DeepGo tokens is 100 million and its token symbol is DGT. The distribution ratio of tokens is as follows.
- Community mining: 50%, which is 50 million DGT in total. This 50% could be further divided, among which 40% would be distributed in the first 4 years, and the remaining 10% would be used as long-term incentives. Details as below:
   - 15% of the total tokens would be distributed in the first year, 10% in the second year, 10% in the third year, and 5% in the fourth year. As a means of long-term incentive, the other 10% would be distributed in the fifth year and beyond.
   - Distribution method: performance mining (20% of total tokens), NudgePool mining (10% of total tokens), transaction aggregation rebate (10% of total tokens), and smart contract Staking (10% of total tokens)
- DeepGo team: 25%, will be locked up in the first 2 years and will be unlocked in the next 3 years.
- Ecological incentives: 10%, which is 10 million DGT in total. Every year 2% will be issued, and the distribution will last for 5 years.
- Institutional investors from seed round: 2%. There has been an 18-month lock-up period starting from October 2020 and would be unlocked linearly in the next 6 months.
- Institutional investors from the strategic round: 3%. A 12-month lock-up period would be started from March 2021 and would be unlocked linearly in the next 6 months.
- Directional institutional investors: 6%. This sum would be locked for 1 month after the initial liquidity is released, and would be unlocked linearly for 12 months afterward.
- Initial liquidity offering: 4%. This amount would be used for DEX and centralized exchanges to provide initial liquidity (DGT-USDT). The initial price is 0.8 USDT.


As a community-based open finance platform, DeepGo would generate most of its protocol tokens from mining and would distribute these to community participants who maintain the system operation. Community mining accounts for 50% of the total supply, of which performance mining accounts for 20%, NudgePool mining accounts for 10%, transaction aggregation rebates account for 10%, and smart contract Staking accounts for 10%.

Developers are the most important participants in the DeepGo ecosystem and are responsible for building various infrastructures. The official DeepGo team is responsible for the development and maintenance of the DeepGo platform and will receive a total of 25% of DeepGo tokens within five years. These tokens are locked in the first 2 years, and then 10% will be unlocked in the third year, 10% in the fourth year, and 5% in the fifth year.

Community developers, investment managers, and other members who have provided services and peripheral products for DeepGo, will be entitled to a total of 10% of DeepGo tokens within four years. Some tokens would be used for community warm-up auctions, early airdrops, and incentives for community members who participate in early tests.

DeepGo reserves 11% of its tokens to attract institutional investors from seed round, strategic round, and directional round. Determined to become a killer platform in the cryptocurrency industry, DeepGo prioritizes institutions that uphold long-term investment.

During the first year, 4% of DGT will be traded on decentralized trading platforms (eg. Uniswap) and our cooperative first-tier exchanges so as to provide initial liquidity for DGT.
